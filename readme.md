# PBVS 2025 Multi-modal Aerial View Image Challenge - C (SAR Classification)

We deeply regret the handling of the final results of this competition. As the first-place team in the testing phase, we have noticed the following critical discrepancies in the official paper: Firstly, according to the competition rules, the final ranking should be based on the testing phase results (our team ranked 1st in testing and 10th in development), yet the paper adopted the development phase rankings instead. Secondly, although our team consistently ranked in the top 10 during the development phase, our results were omitted from the final report.

After the paper was published and we noticed these discrepancies, we contacted them again and were informed that due to dataset release issues, a certificate could be providedâ€”however, we have yet to receive any official written confirmation. As first-time participants who achieved a top ranking in this competition, we are deeply disappointed that factors beyond our control have prevented our work from receiving the academic recognition it deserves. We are therefore compelled to reconsider the appropriateness of making our code publicly available. In the absence of official recognition, releasing the code could lead to unnecessary academic disputes. Consequently, we have decided to withdraw the code.
